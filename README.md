## About SNodeJs

SNodeJs is a Node.js application designed to demonstrate secure coding practices in web development. This project serves as a foundation for building secure, scalable web applications using Node.js.

SNodeJs is a application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. SNodeJs takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://sequelize.org/).
- Database migrations.

SNodeJs is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
